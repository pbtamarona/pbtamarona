## Hi there 👋

🔭 My current research is on the viability of Methane Pyrolysis, an interesting process involving the thermal splitting of methane to produce functional solid carbon and hydrogen gas, also known as 'turquoise hydrogen'.

🤝🏻 I am working under the supervision of Dr.ir. Mahinder Ramdin and Prof.dr.ir. Thijs Vlugt, along with industrial supervisors from Shell and BASF. My PhD project is part of an ARC CBBC multilateral project.
